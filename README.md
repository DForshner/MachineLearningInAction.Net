# MachineLearningInAction.Net

A C# port of the source code from Peter Harrington's Machine Learning in Action book http://manning.com/pharrington/

The original Python source can be found at https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction

==========================

I'm hoping to stay somewhat close to the orginal python code but MathNet.Numerics quite the same as numpy and OxyPlot + WPF requires more boilerplate than pyplot.

Nuget Dependancies:
- MathNet.Numerics
- OxyPlot
