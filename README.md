# MachineLearningInAction.Net

## About

This is C# port of the source code from Peter Harrington's Machine Learning in Action book http://manning.com/pharrington/

The original Python source can be found at https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction

I really recommend buying his book if you are interested in machine learning but find the academic math first approach isn't working for you.  It takes a lot of the "magic" out of machine learning and leaves you with fairly straightforward code.   

I'm hoping to stay somewhat close to the original python code but MathNet.Numerics quite the same as numpy and OxyPlot + WPF requires more boilerplate than pyplot.

# Running the code

Every chapter has a solution file so just open it and run it in debug mode.  I'm not terribly interested in WPF so don't expect anything fancy.  It's just going to open a bunch of WPF windows that mimic the pyplot and console outputs the python code produces.

# Nuget Dependancies:
- MathNet.Numerics
- OxyPlot
